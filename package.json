    "description": "Amazon Neptune  \n\n Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that\nmakes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected\ndatasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph\ndatabase engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the\ngraph with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models\nProperty Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache\nTinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that\nefficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases\nsuch as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug\ndiscovery, and network security. \n\nThis interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a\nprogramming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note\nthat Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might\nrequire techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a\ncommand has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate\nwhether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during\nthe maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list\nfollowing some related topics from the user guide.\n\n Amazon Neptune API Reference",
